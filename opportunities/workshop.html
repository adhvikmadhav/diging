									<h3>Research Methods and Software Engineering Workshop for Computational Humanities and Knowledge Systems</h3>
								</header>
								<h4>BIO/HPS 498/591, CSE 598</h4>
								<p>We’re looking for motivated undergraduate and early Masters/PhD students to participate in a 3-credit computational humanities research and software development workshop this fall. If you’re interested in doing research at the interface of computer science and the humanities (especially history and philosophy of science), this is a great way to get training and hands-on experience in both new and established projects. We’re especially eager to recruit students who wish to develop their own projects over several semesters, e.g. as part of a thesis or chapter. This course is somewhat unusual: instead of exams, reading, or any other homework, we’ll meet for 9 hours each week for a mix of instruction and team-based workshop activities. This course will bring together computer science and humanities students to work on software development and research projects. If you have any questions about the course, or other ways to get involved with computational humanities research at ASU, please don’t hesitate to contact us!</p>
								<h4>Course Description</h4>
								<p>Computer technology is changing the way that we represent knowledge and generate meaning in the 21st century, creating new and exciting opportunities for contact between computer science and the humanities. This course brings together graduate and advanced undergraduate students from the <strong>humanities and computer science</strong> for a hand-on, intensive workshop that advances methods and tools for computational research in the humanities. <strong>Computer science students</strong> will develop advanced competencies in software development principles and practices while carrying out research and development projects as part of an interdisciplinary team. <strong>Humanities students</strong> will learn new methods for computational research, gain experience in advanced computer technologies, and participate in the software development process. This course is an opportunity for CS graduate students to develop advanced skills in an applied research setting, and a stepping-stone into computational humanities research and software development at ASU and beyond.</p>

								<h4>Course Objective &amp; Goals</h4>
								<p>This course is designed to provide hands­-on interdisciplinary research and software development experience for graduate and advanced undergraduate students in computer science and the humanities. Students will gain experience conducting team­based interdisciplinary research and software development. Graduate students will explore and develop an in­depth knowledge of a specific topic of their choosing (e.g. NoSQL databases, semantic web, network analysis/visualization), which will prepare them to carry out independent research in computer science or computational humanities. Humanities students will gain knowledge regarding the design and execution of digital humanities research projects, as well as experience in the software development process. Computer science students will work on bigger software development projects that consist of several parts. They will gain hands­-on experience in an agile software development environment, and will learn technologies such as software frameworks (e.g. Django or Spring) and Continuous Integration software (e.g. Jenkins or Travis CI). We will conduct continuous code reviews to ensure high code quality and improve the students’ coding skills. Instruction will be tailored to the interests and goals of the students as the semester progresses.</p>
