									<h3>Research Methods and Software Engineering Workshop for Computational Humanities and Knowledge Systems</h3>
								</header>
								<h4>BIO/HPS 498/591, CSE 598</h4>
								<p>We’re looking for motivated undergraduate and early Masters/PhD students to participate in a 3-credit computational humanities research and software development workshop this fall. If you’re interested in doing research at the interface of computer science and the humanities (especially history and philosophy of science), this is a great way to get training and hands-on experience in both new and established projects. We’re especially eager to recruit students who wish to develop their own projects over several semesters, e.g. as part of a thesis or chapter. This course is somewhat unusual: instead of exams, reading, or any other homework, we’ll meet for 9 hours each week for a mix of instruction and team-based workshop activities. This course will bring together computer science and humanities students to work on software development and research projects. If you have any questions about the course, or other ways to get involved with computational humanities research at ASU, please don’t hesitate to contact us!</p>
								<h4>Course Description</h4>
								<p>Computer technology is changing the way that we represent knowledge and generate meaning in the 21st century, creating new and exciting opportunities for contact between computer science and the humanities. This course brings together graduate and advanced undergraduate students from the <strong>humanities and computer science</strong> for a hand-on, intensive workshop that advances methods and tools for computational research in the humanities. <strong>Computer science students</strong> will develop advanced competencies in software development principles and practices while carrying out research and development projects as part of an interdisciplinary team. <strong>Humanities students</strong> will learn new methods for computational research, gain experience in advanced computer technologies, and participate in the software development process. This course is an opportunity for CS graduate students to develop advanced skills in an applied research setting, and a stepping-stone into computational humanities research and software development at ASU and beyond.</p>
								<p>For more information, including details on how to enroll, please contact Julia Damerow (<a href="mailto:jdamerow@asu.edu">jdamerow@asu.edu</a>) or Erick Peirson (<a href="mailto:erick.peirson@asu.edu">erick.peirson@asu.edu</a>).</p>
