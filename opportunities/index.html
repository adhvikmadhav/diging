								</header>
								<h4>BIO/HPS 498/591, CSE 494/598</h4>
								<p>We’re looking for motivated undergraduate and early Masters/PhD students to participate in a 3-credit computational humanities research and software development workshop this fall. If you’re interested in doing research at the interface of computer science and the humanities (especially history and philosophy of science), this is a great way to get training and hands-on experience in both new and established projects. We’re especially eager to recruit students who wish to develop their own projects over several semesters, e.g. as part of a thesis or chapter. This course is somewhat unusual: instead of exams, reading, or any other homework, we’ll meet for 9 hours each week for a mix of instruction and team-based workshop activities. This course will bring together computer science and humanities students to work on software development and research projects.</p>
