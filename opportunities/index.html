									<h3>Fall 2015: Research Methods and Software Engineering Workshop for Computational Humanities and Knowledge Systems</h3>
								</header>
								<h4>BIO/HPS 498/591, CSE 494/598</h4>
								<p>Computer technology is changing the way that we represent knowledge and generate meaning in the 21st century, creating new and exciting opportunities for contact between computer science and the humanities. This course brings together graduate and advanced undergraduate students from the <strong>humanities and computer science</strong> for a hand-on, intensive workshop that advances methods and tools for computational research in the humanities. <strong>Computer science students</strong> will develop advanced competencies in software development principles and practices while carrying out research and development projects as part of an interdisciplinary team. <strong>Humanities students</strong> will learn new methods for computational research, gain experience in advanced computer technologies, and participate in the software development process. This course is an opportunity for CS graduate students to develop advanced skills in an applied research setting, and a stepping-stone into computational humanities research and software development at ASU and beyond.</p>
								<p>For more information, including details on how to enroll, please contact Julia Damerow (<a href="mailto:jdamerow@asu.edu">jdamerow@asu.edu</a>) or Erick Peirson (<a href="mailto:erick.peirson@asu.edu">erick.peirson@asu.edu</a>).</p>
